// Your task is to create a function that does four basic mathematical operations.

// The function should take three arguments - operation(string/char), value1(number), value2(number).
// The function should return result of numbers after applying the chosen operation.
// Examples(Operator, value1, value2) --> output

// ('+', 4, 7) --> 11
// ('-', 15, 18) --> -3
// ('*', 5, 5) --> 25
// ('/', 49, 7) --> 7

const basicOp = (operation, value1, value2) => {
  if (operation === "+") {
    return value1 + value2;
  } else if (operation === "-") {
    return value1 - value2;
  } else if (operation === "*") {
    return value1 * value2;
  } else if (operation === "/") {
    return value1 / value2;
  }
};
//  const basicOp = (operation, value1, value2) => {
//     return eval(value1 + operation + value2);
//  }
// failed because initially used , instead of + inside of eval()

// Timmy & Sarah think they are in love, but around where they live, they will only know once they pick a flower each. If one of the flowers has an even number of petals and the other has an odd number of petals it means they are in love.

// Write a function that will take the number of petals of each flower and return true if they are in love and false if they aren't.

function lovefunc(flower1, flower2) {
  return flower1 % 2 !== flower2 % 2;
  // moment of truth
}
